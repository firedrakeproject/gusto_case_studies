## Dry Baroclinic Wave on the Sphere

The deep atmosphere dry baroclinic wave from Ullrich et al. 2014:
''A proposed baroclinic wave test case for deep- and shallow-atmosphere
dynamical cores'', QJRMS.

This is a 3D test on the sphere, with an initial state that is in unsteady
balance, with a perturbation added to the wind.

This setup uses a cubed-sphere with the order 1 finite elements.
